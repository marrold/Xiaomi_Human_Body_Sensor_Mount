This is my first attempt at making a laser cut mount for the Xiaomi Human Body Sensor. The idea is you can screw / attacht the moount to the top of a door frame and use it to mount the sensor without damaging paint work - ideal if you're in a rented property. The cutouts should allow you to bend the mount on a strip heater if required.

This is currently a work in progress so your mileage may vary.

- Bend with a strip heater if required.
